## Summary

After testing GPT-6 Sol, the creator is staying with a Codex multi-agent setup: Astra as the orchestrator and Luna as subagents. His reason is that Sol costs too much to run as a subagent and is not smart enough to be the orchestrator. The lesson is to choose a model for each role based on cost and intelligence.

## Key points

- Multi-agent setup in Codex: one orchestrator model plans and delegates the work, and subagent models carry out the tasks.
- The creator's preferred setup is Astra as orchestrator and Luna as subagents.
- GPT-6 Sol was rejected for both roles: too expensive for a subagent and less intelligent than Astra as an orchestrator.
- Subagents run many times, so cost matters most there. The orchestrator makes the key decisions, so reasoning quality matters most there.

## Try this

- [ ] When building a multi-agent setup, compare models separately for the orchestrator and subagent roles, weighing cost against intelligence.
