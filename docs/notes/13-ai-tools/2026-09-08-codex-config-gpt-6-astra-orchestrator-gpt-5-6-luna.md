## Summary

Melvin Vivas shares the .codex/config.toml he uses in OpenAI Codex. The orchestrator is GPT-6 Astra and the subagents are GPT-5.6 Luna. He found Astra at low reasoning effort handed the app back before it was finished, so he raised the reasoning effort to medium, and it now works well.

## Key points

- The Codex config file lives at .codex/config.toml.
- The root/orchestrator uses model = "gpt-6-astra" with model_reasoning_effort = "medium".
- Subagents use model = "gpt-5.6-luna" with model_reasoning_effort = "medium".
- At low reasoning effort, Astra declared the task done too early and handed over an unfinished app.
- Raising the orchestrator's reasoning effort from low to medium fixed the early handoffs.
- Caution: the snippet repeats the `model` key at the top level, which is invalid TOML. In a real config, subagent settings must go in their own section or profile, so check the Codex docs.

## Try this

- [ ] If the orchestrator hands work back before it is finished, raise its model\_reasoning\_effort from low to medium.
