## Summary

The creator sets up Claude Code with Opus 5.5 as the 'Advisor' (planning and reasoning) and Sonnet 5.5 as the 'Executor' (doing the work). Splitting the work this way gets strong reasoning from the large model and speed and lower cost from the smaller one.

## Key points

- Use Opus 5.5 as the Advisor model in Claude Code for planning and hard reasoning.
- Use Sonnet 5.5 as the Executor model to carry out the plan.
- Pairing a strong planner with a fast executor balances quality, speed and cost.
- This is a general multi-model agent pattern (planner/executor).
