## Summary

Claude Code added a `claude plugin eval` command for measuring how much value a plugin or skill adds. You write test cases, run the plugin against them and score the runs. Then you run the same cases without the plugin to compare. The creator wants to try the same approach with Codex plugins.

## Key points

- `claude plugin eval` benchmarks plugins and skills on your own use cases
- Write test cases that reflect your real tasks
- Run the plugin or skill against them and score each run
- Run each case again without the plugin to get a baseline
- Compare the two sets of scores to see whether the plugin helps or needs more work
