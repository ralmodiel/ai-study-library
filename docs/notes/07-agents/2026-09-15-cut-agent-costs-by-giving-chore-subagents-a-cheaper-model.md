## Summary

The creator says routine chore tasks don't need a top model like Astra. His subagent runs on Luna at medium reasoning effort, which saves money. The lesson is to match each subagent's model to how hard its task is.

## Key points

- Chore tasks (routine, low-complexity work) don't need the strongest, most expensive model.
- Give subagents a cheaper, smaller model (here Luna at medium effort) and save the top model (Astra) for hard reasoning.
- Choosing a model per task is a simple way to lower the cost of agent workflows.
