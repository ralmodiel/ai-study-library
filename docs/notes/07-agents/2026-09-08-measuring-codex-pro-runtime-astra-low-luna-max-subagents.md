## Summary

Melvin Vivas reports real usage figures from Codex Pro (5x). A one-hour run with Astra (low reasoning) as orchestrator and Luna (max reasoning) as subagents used about 7% of the weekly limit. From that he estimates about 14.3 hours of runtime per week, and notes that a run using only Astra would burn limits faster.

## Key points

- Setup: Astra at low reasoning as orchestrator, Luna at max reasoning as subagents.
- A 1-hour run left 93% of the weekly Pro 5x limit.
- That projects to about 14.3 hours of total runtime per weekly limit.
- Delegating to Luna subagents lowers usage; Astra alone would use limits faster.
- Measure usage per hour of runtime to plan your agent budget.
