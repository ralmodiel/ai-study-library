## Summary

The creator found an unexpected 1% drop in his Codex usage and traced it to a mixture-of-agents setting in his Hermes agent. The takeaway: agent setups that call several models can spend your subscription quota without you noticing.

## Key points

- Mixture-of-agents makes extra model calls that can count against ChatGPT/Codex limits.
- If quota drops unexpectedly, check your agent's configuration.
- He turned the feature off to stop it.
