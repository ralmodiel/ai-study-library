## Summary

Melvin Vivas suggests a cheaper Codex multi-agent setup for Plus users. Usage was high mainly because the expensive Astra model ran as the root orchestrator at high reasoning effort. His fix is to make GPT-5.6 Luna at max reasoning the orchestrator and use Astra only as a reviewer.

## Key points

- Heavy usage in the Astra-Luna subagents setup likely came from Astra running as the root orchestrator with reasoning effort set to high by default.
- Cheaper option: set the root orchestrator in config.toml to model = "gpt-5.6-luna" with model_reasoning_effort = "max".
- Keep the stronger Astra model only for the reviewer role, so it runs less often.
- Pick each role's model and reasoning effort on purpose, because these settings drive cost and usage limits.
- The creator said a guide on how to measure usage was coming.

## Try this

- [ ] If usage is high on a Plus plan, set the root orchestrator to gpt-5.6-luna with model\_reasoning\_effort = "max" and keep Astra as the reviewer.
- [ ] Check what reasoning effort your orchestrator model uses by default.
