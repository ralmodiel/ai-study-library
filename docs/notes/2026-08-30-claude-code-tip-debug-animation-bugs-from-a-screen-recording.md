## Summary

When a bug involves animation (such as a screen flicker) that a screenshot can't capture, record a video of your manual testing and ask Claude Code to watch it and describe the bug. Claude Code then sent test variants for the creator to check on his phone, narrowed down which code scenario caused the flicker, and fixed it.

## Key points

- Screenshots miss animated or timing bugs like flicker; screen recordings capture them.
- Record your manual QA session until the bug appears, then give the video to Claude Code.
- Ask the agent to watch the video and name the bug.
- Bisect with the agent: it sends test scenarios, you check them on the device (here, Telegram on an iPhone).
- Tell the agent which scenario causes the bug so it can find and fix the responsible code.
- The creator suggests turning this workflow into a reusable agent skill and plans to try it in Codex.

## Try this

- [ ] When manual QA finds an animated bug, record a video until you capture it.
- [ ] Ask Claude Code to watch the recording and identify the bug.
- [ ] Work with the agent to test scenarios on the device until the cause is isolated, then let it fix the code.
- [ ] Package video-based bug reproduction as a reusable skill for coding agents.
